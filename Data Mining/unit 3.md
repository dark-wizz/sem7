### Part A

- [ ] List the task primitives in the knowledge discovery process
  > [!info]- Ans
  >
  > - data cleaning
  > - integration
  > - selection
  > - transformation
  > - mining
  > - pattern evaluation
  > - knowledge presentation
- [ ] why is feature selection essential in data mining
  > [!info]- Ans
  > to identify and choose most relevant features in dataset
- [ ] define pattern evaluation
  > [!info]- Ans
  > identifying strictly increasing patterns representing knowledge based on the given measure

### Part B

- [ ] outline few of the knowledge representation techniques
  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > - logical (predictive logic)
  > - sematic networks (graphical structure)
  > - frame (structured data w/ slots & fillers)
  > - rule based (conitional statements)
- [ ] explain the bining and entropy based data discretization
  > [!note]- Notes
  > method of converting huge number of data into smaller one
  >
  > - binning
  >   - equal width binning
  >   - equal frequency binning
  > - Entrophy based
