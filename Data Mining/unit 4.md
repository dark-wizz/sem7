### Part A

- [ ] name the kernel functions used in SVM
  > [!info]- Ans
  >
  > - Linear kernel
  > - Polynomial kernel
  > - radial basis function kernel
  > - sigmoid kernel
- [ ] what do you mean by market basket analysis
  > [!info]- Ans
  >
  > - used to discover associations between products purshased together
- [ ] what do you mean by clustering
  > [!info]- Ans
  > group similar datapoints together

---

- [ ] name the two types of probabilities in baye's algorithm
  > [!info]- Ans
  >
  > - prior probability
  > - conditional
  >   . - posterier
- [ ] what do you mean by an association rule
  > [!info]- Ans
  > finds interesting relationships among large set of data items

---

### Part B

- [ ] demonstrate the classification by back propagation
  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > - staic
  > - recurrent
- [ ] illustrate k means clustering algorithm with the suitable example
  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > - k data points as initial centroids
  > - assign each data points to its nearest cluster based on euclidean distance
  > - recalc centroids as mean of all data points assigned to the cluster
  > - repeat until convergence

### Part C

- [ ] discuss on the principle of hierarchical clustering

  > [!info]- Ans
  > [hierarchial clustering](https://www.javatpoint.com/hierarchical-clustering-in-data-mining)

  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > - unsupervised algo - determines successive clusters - based on pre clusters
  >   ###### Agglomerative heirarchial
  > - Agglomerative nesting (AGNES)
  > - each node - clustering - cluster group (bottom up)
  > - proximity matrix (similarity me and others)
  >   ![[img/agglomerative.png]]
  >   ###### Divisive clustering
  > - opposite of hierarchial clustering

- [ ] experiment with constant based cluster analysis and outliers analysis

- [ ] discuss on the principle of SVM algorithm with any diagram
