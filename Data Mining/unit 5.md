  > [!info]- Ans
  >
  > ###### structured
  >
  > - relational data basr table
  > - spreadsheets
  >
  > ###### unstructered
  >
  > - text docs
  > - posts
- [ ] what is spatial database
  > [!info]- Ans
  >
  > - store and manage spatial data
  > - geo loc, maps, coords

---

- [ ] list any two examples of small data and big data
- [ ] what is sequence data used for
  > [!info]- Ans
  > show how variable change over time

---

- [ ] what is meant by times-series data
  > [!info]- Ans
  > coll of data points that are recorded at regular intervals of time

---

### Part B

- [ ] explain exploratory data analysis

  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > - summaracize data main characteristics (visual modes)
  > - used to grain insights - detect pattern - identify outliers - before applying moddels or algos
  >
  > ###### steps
  >
  > 1. collect - clean
  > 2. descriptive statistics
  > 3. visualixation
