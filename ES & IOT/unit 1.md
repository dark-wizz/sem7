### Part A
- [ ] recall the terms PROM and EPROM
- [ ] name the roles of embedded system
- [ ] Define ASIC
- [ ] List the advantages of commercial off the shelf components (COTs)
---
- [ ] find the mean time between failure for a system which has operating correctly for 25 hours. during this period 5 failures occurred. adding all failures, totally the system was not working for 5 hours.
- [ ] what are the four phases of EDLC?

### Part B
- [ ] list down the characteristics of embedded systems
- [ ] recall about typical embedded system
- [ ] contrast the microprocessor with microcontroller in details
- [ ] demonstrate feasibility of inter integrated circuit bus (I2C) on board communication interface
---
- [ ] find the mean time between failure, when a mixture running for 12 hours per day breakdown trice in a span of 10 days. the first breakdown occurred 15 hours from the start time and took 3 hours to repair.bthe second breakdown occurred 30 hours from the start time and took 5 hours to repair. the third breakdown occurred 60 hours from the start time and took 10 hours to repair before to mixer was operating normally
- [ ] list the various non operational quality attributes

### Part C
- [ ] summarize the architecture of IDE in embedded system
- [ ] outline the review of primary memory in embedded system
---
- [ ] explain the features and attributes of an embedded system
- [ ] summarize the following EDLC approaches
	- prototyping method
	- Iterative method
