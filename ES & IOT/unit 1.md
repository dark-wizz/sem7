### Part A

- [ ] recall the terms PROM and EPROM
  > [!info]- Ans
  > EPROM (erasable programmable read-only memory) and PROM (programmable read-only memory) are both types of memory chips that store data and are non-volatile
- [ ] name the roles of embedded system
  > [!info]- Ans
  > Embedded system is used to build consumer electronics, industrial machinery, aeroplanes, automobiles, medical devices, vending machines, cameras, and agricultural and home appliances
- [ ] Define ASIC
  > [!info]- Ans
  > An Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is a specialized electronic circuit that's designed for a specific purpose
- [ ] List the advantages of commercial off the shelf components (COTs)
  > [!info]- Ans
  > These products are ready-to-use upon installation and are designed to easily integrate with an existing system

### Part B

- [ ] list down the characteristics of embedded systems
  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > - task specific
  > - low cost
  > - time specific
  > - less power
  > - high stability
  > - high efficiency
  > - minimal user interface
  > - high reliablity
- [ ] recall about typical embedded system
  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > - hardware
  > - software
  > - RTOS
- [x] contrast the microprocessor with microcontroller in details
- [ ] demonstrate feasibility of inter integrated circuit bus (I2C) on board communication interface
  > [!note]- Notes
  > **Inter Integrated Circuit** allows for short-distance communication bw microcontroller and on-board peropherals

  >
  > - two wire serial comm: SDA & SCL
  > - multi master, salve
  > - sync
  > - bi-dir
  > - low power consptn
