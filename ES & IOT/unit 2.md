### Part A

- [ ] tell the purpose of cross compiler
  > [!info]- Ans
  > compiles code for a platform other than the one it is compiling
- [ ] list out any two high level language used in embedded system
  > [!info]- Ans
  > java, python, embedded c/c++
- [ ] what is integrated development environment (IDE)
  > [!info]- Ans
  > a software application that provides a set of tools for developing embedded software
- [ ] define assembly level language
  > [!info]- Ans
  > Assembly language is a low-level programming language that's used to translate high-level languages into machine languageAssembly language is a low-level programming language that's used to translate high-level languages into machine language

### Part B

- [x] show the IDE components of embedded system environment
- [ ] relate RTOS and non RTOS
  > [!note]- Notes
  > RTOS is designed for situations where time and precision are critical, while NRTOS is better suited for general computing.
- [ ] recall the design and development of embedded firmware
  > [!note]- Notes
  > involves writing code to control the functions of embedded device
  >
  > - conventional procedural based
  > - embedded os based
- [ ] find the purpose of embedded firmware testing
  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > - Unit
  > - integrated
  > - system

### Part C

- [ ] illustrate the survey on codesign of hardware and software in embedded system
  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > - meeting system level objectives by exploiting the trade offs between hw & sw in a system through thier concurent design
  > - **Key concepts**: concurrent & integrated
  >
  > ##### componenets
  >
  > - specification
  > - hw / sw partitioning
  > - scheduling
  > - modelling
- [ ] show the integration and testing of hardware and firmware
  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > ##### hw tesing
  >
  > - sw based self tesing
  > - ATPG (Auto Test Pattern Generator)
  > - BIST (Build in Self test)
