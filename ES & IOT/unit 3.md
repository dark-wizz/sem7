### Part A

- [ ] what are the characteristics of IOT
  > [!info]- Ans
  >
  > - connectivity
  > - sensors
  > - information
  > - Communication
  > - intelligence
  > - action
  > - ecosystem
- [ ] list out any two IOT enablers
  > [!info]- Ans
  >
  > - cloud computing
  > - 5G Networking
- [ ] define MQTT protocol
  > [!info]- Ans
  > simple, lightweight messaging protocol used to establish connection between devices

### Part B

- [ ] what are the communication protocol associated in IOT
  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > - **wifi**: high speed, low dsit
  > - **bt**: low power, short range
  > - **zigbee**: low power, low speed
  > - **LoRaWAN**: long range, low power
  > - **NB-IoT**: narrowband, cellular tech
- [x] summarise the request response communication model in IOT
- [ ] write down software defined network in detail
  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > - network management, dynamic, programatically net config
  > - sw ctrl, not hw(traditional)
  > - seperate control(decides) and data(moves) plane
- [ ] different between M2M and IOT systems
  > [!note]- Note
  > | m2m | iot |

  > | p2p | n/w |
  > |h/w & s/w | h/w based|
  > |b2b, b2c | b2b |

### Part C

- [ ] explain the main components of IOT in detail
  > [!note]- Notes
