### Part A

- [ ] define MAC protocol
  > [!info]- Ans
  > Media Access Control - controls how devices on a n/w acess a shared communiaction medium
- [ ] list various sensor devices in IOT
  > [!info]- Ans
  >
  > - temp
  > - pressure
  > - proximity
- [ ] define LoRa WAN
  > [!info]- Ans
  > mac protocol, long range, low power, lora radio mod tech

### Part B

- [ ] what are wireless technology used for IOT? explain any one in detail
  > [!note]- Notes
  >
  > - **wifi**: high speed, low dsit
  > - **bt**: low power, short range
  > - **zigbee**: low power, low speed
  > - **LoRaWAN**: long range, low power
  > - **NB-IoT**: narrowband, cellular tech
