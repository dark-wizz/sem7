- [ ] Define resource crunch.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > A situation where the demand for resources (such as time, money, personnel, or materials) exceeds their availability, leading to challenges in completing projects or tasks efficiently.
- [ ] who is professional?
  > [!info]- Ans
  > An individual who possesses specialized knowledge and skills in a particular field and adheres to established ethical standards and codes of conduct within that profession.

### Part B

- [ ] Interpret the concepts on consensus and controversy.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > Consensus and controversy are key concepts in ethical decision- making.
  >
  > > [!info]- Consensus
  > > Consensus represents general agreement among individuals or groups, often arrived at after thorough discussion and compromise. It is important for fostering cooperation, building trust, and ensuring that collective decisions reflect shared values. However, reaching consensus can sometimes suppress diverse perspectives if dissenting voices feel pressured to agree.
  >
  > > [!info]- Controversy
  > > controversy arises when there are differing viewpoints on moral or ethical issues. Controversy can be constructive, as it encourages critical thinking, the examination of assumptions, and the consideration of alternative solutions. For engineers and professionals, balancing consensus and controversy is crucial in resolving ethical dilemmas, as it allows both collaborative solutions and healthy debate on contentious issues, which ultimately strengthens decision-making processes.
  >
  > > [!info]- Scenario
  > > In a software development team, there is a consensus that a new feature should be implemented. However, a controversy arises when some team members argue that this feature might compromise user privacy. The disagreement forces the team to discuss the ethical implications and decide to modify the feature for better privacy, demonstrating how controversy can lead to ethical improvements.

- [ ] Outline the concepts of professions and professionalism.
  > [!info]- Ans
  >
  > > [!info]- professions
  > > A profession is typically defined as an occupation requiring specialized knowledge, education, and often certification, such as engineering, medicine, or law. Professions have established codes of ethics, standards of practice, and a commitment to serving the public interest, which distinguishes them from other types of work.
  >
  > > [!info]- professionalim
  > > Professionalism refers to the conduct, aims, and qualities that characterize individuals within a profession. This includes attributes like integrity, accountability, respect, and a dedication to continual learning. Professionalism demands adherence to ethical standards and a commitment to competence. Engineers, for example, are expected to prioritize safety, uphold public welfare, and communicate honestly with clients and colleagues. Embracing professionalism strengthens trust in professions and ensures responsible practice that benefits society.
  >
  > > [!info]- Scenario
  > > A civil engineer, as part of a profession, is hired to oversee a bridge construction project. Despite pressures to cut costs, the engineer upholds professionalism by refusing to compromise on material quality or safety standards, ensuring the bridge meets ethical and safety guidelines to protect the public.
- [ ] Summarize the uses of Ethical Theories.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > Ethical theories provide frameworks to understand and analyze moral issues. Their uses include:
  >
  > > [!info]- Guiding Decision-Making
  > > Ethical theories offer structured approaches to evaluating right and wrong. Utilitarianism, for example, promotes actions that maximize overall happiness, helping professionals weigh benefits and harms in decision-making.
  >
  > > [!info]- Clarifying Values
  > > Theories like deontology focus on duties and rights, aiding in identifying core values that should guide actions regardless of consequences.
  >
  > > [!info]- Resolving Conflicts
  > > Ethical theories help in resolving conflicts by providing consistent principles. Virtue ethics, for instance, focuses on character and the promotion of good virtues.
  >
  > > [!info]- Informing Policy and Codes
  > > Theories provide foundational principles for creating policies and ethical codes in professions, ensuring they reflect moral reasoning.
  >
  > > [!info]- Educating and Developing Moral Judgment
  > > Learning about different theories helps professionals develop a well-rounded moral perspective, enabling them to adapt to complex scenarios.
- [ ] Interpret the needs of moral autonomy
  > [!info]- Ans
  > Moral autonomy refers to an individual’s ability to think critically, make independent ethical judgments, and act based on personal principles rather than external pressure. The need for moral autonomy in professionals is vital for several reasons:
  >
  > > [!info]- "Integrity" and Authenticity
  > > Autonomy supports integrity, allowing professionals to act consistently with their values and ensuring authenticity in their actions.
  >
  > > [!info]- Informed Decision-Making
  > > Autonomous individuals evaluate situations and consequences independently, leading to more thoughtful and ethically sound decisions.
  >
  > > [!info]- Responsibility and Accountability
  > > With autonomy, professionals take responsibility for their decisions, promoting accountability.
  >
  > > [!info]- Resilience Against Unethical Pressure
  > > Autonomy empowers individuals to resist unethical demands or norms in their organization or industry.
  >
  > > [!info]- Encouragement of Innovation and Improvement
  > > Autonomous thinkers are often better at problem-solving, innovation, and ethical improvements, as they critically evaluate and contribute to their field.
  >
  > > [!info]- Scenario
  > > A chemical engineer working in a plant is aware of potentially hazardous emissions that could affect nearby communities. Exercising moralautonomy, the engineer independently assesses the ethical concerns and decides to report the issue to upper management and, if necessary, regulatory bodies, even if this might create conflict within the company.

- [ ] compare normative inquiry with conceptional in inquiry.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > Normative inquiry focuses on determining what ought to be, emphasizing ethical and moral judgments, often guiding actions and behavior. It aims to establish standards or norms. Conceptual inquiry, on the other hand, explores the meanings and structures of concepts and ideas, seeking to clarify and define terms and frameworks. While normative inquiry evaluates value-based actions, conceptual inquiry is concerned with understanding the concepts behind those actions.
  >
  > > [!info]- Scenario
  > > Normative inquiry can be seen in ethical debates such as the regulation of autonomous vehicles. For instance, should self-driving cars prioritize the safety of passengers over pedestrians in emergency situations? The normative question focuses on what society deems "right" in these life-or-death scenarios. In contrast, conceptual inquiry would involve analyzing the meaning of terms like "autonomy" or "moral agency," which underpin these discussions.
- [ ] explain Gilligans theory in brief.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > Gilligan's theory of moral development emphasizes the ethics of care, suggesting that women tend to prioritize relationships, empathy, and care in moral decision-making, as opposed to the justice-based approach proposed by Kohlberg. According to Gilligan, moral growth involves understanding the importance of care and maintaining relationships, particularly in situations of conflict, which challenges traditional male-centered views of ethics.
  >
  > > [!info]- Scenario
  > > Gilligan's ethics of care can be observed in medical settings, where a doctor might prioritize a patient's well-being and comfort over strict protocols or impersonal treatment, particularly when dealing with emotionally distressing diagnoses. This approach contrasts with the more justice-oriented approach of maximizing efficiency or resources in healthcare.

### Part C

- [ ] Explain about the differences of Kohlberg and Gilligan's theory.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > [Kohlberg theory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/engineering_ethics/engineering_ethics_kohlbergs_theory.htm) > [Gilligan's theory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/engineering_ethics/engineering_ethics_gilligans_theory.htm)
- [ ] Illustrate the various types of inquiry.
  > [!info]- Ans
