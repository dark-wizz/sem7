### Part C

- [ ] Interpret the Challenger case study.
  >[!note]- Notes
  >![[Challenger case study]]
  
  > [!info]- Ans
  > The Challenger disaster on January 28, 1986, involved the failure of NASA’s space shuttle Challenger, killing all seven crew members just 73 seconds after liftoff. This tragic event was caused by a technical failure in the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) and compounded by management’s disregard for engineering concerns, raising serious ethical questions about safety and decision-making.
  >
  > > [!info]- Technical Aspects of the Disaster
  > > The Challenger shuttle's SRBs contained O-rings designed to seal joints and prevent hot gases from escaping. These rings, however, were made of a synthetic rubber that became less flexible in low temperatures, causing engineers at Morton Thiokol to recognize that the cold conditions on the day of launch (29°F) could prevent proper sealing. Despite evidence of O-ring erosion in previous missions, engineers’ concerns were ultimately disregarded by NASA management, leading to the catastrophic leak of combustion gases and the eventual explosion of the shuttle.

  > > [!info]- **Key Ethical Dilemmas and Management Failures**
  > > The Challenger disaster presented critical ethical questions: What is an engineer’s role in ensuring safety, and who has the authority to make final launch decisions? Engineers at Morton Thiokol initially warned NASA about the risks of launching in cold temperatures. However, pressured by schedule demands and public expectations, NASA management chose to proceed. This decision reflects a culture of “go fever” that prioritized launching on time over comprehensive risk assessment, even when safety was compromised.
  >
  > > [!info]- **Rogers Commission Investigation**
  > > Following the tragedy, President Reagan appointed the Rogers Commission to investigate the cause. The commission found NASA’s management to be responsible for dismissing Morton Thiokol engineers’ warnings and criticized the organization for poor communication and safety practices. Recommendations included revising NASA’s safety protocols and establishing better communication channels between engineers and decision-makers to prevent future oversights.
