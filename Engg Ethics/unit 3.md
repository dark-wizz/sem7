### Part A

- [ ] Define risk benefit analysis in the context of safety assessments.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > This analysis weighs potential risks against benefits to determine the safety and acceptability of engineering practices or projects.
- [ ] Identify two major events related to satisfy risks that are discussed in the case studies of Chernobyl and Bhopal.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > Key safety risk events include the reactor explosion in Chernobyl and the gas leak in Bhopal, both with devastating health and environmental consequences.
- [ ] Describe the role of government regulators in managing safety risks.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > Regulators establish safety standards, enforce compliance, and ensure public and environmental protection.

### Part B

- [ ] List the key step involved in the assessment of safety ad risk, and explain their significance in ensuring policy safety.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > The key steps include hazard identification, risk analysis, risk evaluation, and risk control. Hazard identification involves recognizing potential dangers, risk analysis estimates the likelihood and severity of these hazards, risk evaluation prioritizes risks based on their significance, and risk control involves implementing measures to mitigate risks. These steps ensure public safety by systematically addressing potential dangers and minimizing harm through informed decision-making.
  >
  > > [!info]- Scenario
  > > In the construction industry, safety risk assessments are critical. A project manager identifies hazards like heavy machinery and high-altitude work. Through risk analysis, the manager evaluates the likelihood of accidents andassesses the severity, such as potential falls. They implement control measures like safety nets, training, and strict guidelines to ensure workers' safety. Regular assessments ensure public and worker safety by proactively addressing hazards.
- [ ] Outline the main components of a risk benefit analysis, and provide an example of how it can be applied in a real-world scenario.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > Risk-benefit analysis involves identifying potential risks, estimating their probability and severity, evaluating the potential benefits, and comparing the risks to the benefits. For example, in introducing new technology like autonomous cars, engineers weigh the potential risk of accidents against the benefits of improved road safety and convenience. This helps make decisions that maximize societal good while minimizing harm.
  >
  > > [!info]- Scenario
  > > When introducing drones for package delivery, companies perform a risk-benefit analysis. The risks include potential crashes and privacy concerns, while benefits include faster delivery times and reduced transportation costs. Weighing these factors helps businesses make informed decisions that balance technological advancement with public safety.
- [ ] Summarize the approaches taken by government regulators to reduce safety risks, and identify the challenges they face in the process.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > Regulators set safety standards, conduct inspections, enforce compliance, and implement risk-reduction strategies. They also issue guidelines and mandates to minimize hazards. Challenges include keeping pace with technological advancements, ensuring consistent enforcement, and balancing economic costs with safety. For example, regulators face challenges in overseeing emerging industries like AI or biotechnology, where new risks are not always fully understood.
  >
  > > [!info]- Scenario
  > > The FDA regulates pharmaceutical drugs by requiring rigorous testing and compliance with safety standards. Regulators also mandate warnings about side effects. However, challenges include ensuring that new drugs are safe and effective while addressing concerns about delays in getting important treatments to market. Balancing regulatory processes with innovation is an ongoing challenge.
- [ ] Describe the major consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and the Bhopal gas tragedy, and state how these events influenced safety regulations.
  > [!info]- Ans
  > The Chernobyl disaster caused widespread radiation contamination, health problems, and environmental damage, influencing stricter nuclear safetystandards. The Bhopal gas tragedy led to thousands of deaths and long-term health issues, spurring the introduction of more stringent chemical plant safety regulations. These events highlighted the importance of safety oversight, emergency preparedness, and the need for regulatory reforms to prevent such disasters.
  >
  > > [!info]- Scenario
  > > Following the Chernobyl disaster, countries worldwide, including the U.S. and European nations, updated nuclear safety regulations. Similarly, after Bhopal, stricter chemical safety laws were enacted globally. These events prompted the establishment of tighter monitoring and emergency preparedness standards in high-risk industries like nuclear power and chemical manufacturing.
