### Part A
- [ ] How will you write a print statement to print the string
	`C:\new_folder\test.txt`
- [ ] Show the output of following loop
	```python
	for count in range(5):
		print(count, end = " ")
	```
- [ ] Find the equivalent Python representation for the following expression.
	```python
	score = 3*scale if x>10 else 4*scale
	```
- [ ] What is `2 * list1` if `list1 = [30, 1, 2, 1, 0]`

### Part B
- [ ] Interpret the following block of code.
	```python
	i = 1
	while True:
		if i%3 == 0:
			break
		print(i)
		i += 1
	```
- [ ] Show the output of following block of code.
	```python
	n = 5
	for i in range(n):
		for j in range(i, n):
			print("*", end = " ")
		print()
	```
- [ ] Develop a Python program to find the elements that are divided by 5 or 7 from a list and display in ascending order.
- [ ] Develop a Python program to replace all vowels by * in a string.

### Part C
- [ ] Outline the operations of list datatype.
- [ ] Summarize the methods of string datatype.
