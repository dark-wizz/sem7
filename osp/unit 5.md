### Part A
- [ ] How will you interpret the following statement?
	```python
	if __name__ === "__main__"
	```
- [ ] What is the mangled name of the method `__getname()` defined in a class student?
- [ ] List down any  4 built-in exceptions of python.
---
- [ ] recall the methods to read 30 characters from a file
- [ ] when do you use in `__init__` method in python

### Part B
- [ ] Apply sorted function to
	- Sort `n = [10, 6, 5, 9, 2]` in descending order.
	- Sort `w = ['banana' ,'apple', 'cherry']` by string length.
	- Sort `t = [(1, 'banana'),(2, 'apple'),(3, 'cherry')]` by the second element.
- [ ] Solve the problem arouse in running the following program?
	```python
	class A:
		def __init__(self, i):
			self.i = i
	def main():
		a  = A()
		print(a, i)
	main()
	```
- [ ] Utilize transformation functions to display
	- "Even" for even numbers and "Odd" for odd numbers.
	- Maximum element in a list.
- [ ] Make use of transformation functions to display the following from the list L, in the range(1, 11).
	- Square of the values.
	- Values divisible by 3.
---
- [ ] which of the following function calls are correct for the function header.
- [ ] defined map and lambda functions to display the following from the list l in the range 1, 11 squares of the values cubes of the values


### Part C
- [ ] Construct a class named Account that contains:
	1. A protected attribute id for the account, A private attribute balance for the account.
	2. A constructor with id 000, balance 1000
	3. A public method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account.
	4. A public method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account.
	5. A private method to find the balance.
- [ ] Develop Python program to
	- Overload '-' operator to subtract two complex numbers
	- Overload '<' operator to compare two numbers.
---
- [ ] build class named account that contains
	- private date of field named ID for the account, a private data field name balance for the account
	- constructed that creates an account with the specified ID default 0, balance default 100 
	- method named withdraw that withdraws specified amount from the account
	- method name the deposit the deposit a specified amount to the account
	- create an account object with an ID of 1122 and then balance of 20,000 use the withdraw method to withdraw 2500, use desposit method to deposit 3000 and print the ID balance
- [ ] develop python programs to implement the different types of inheritance
