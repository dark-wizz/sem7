### Part A
- [ ] How will you interpret the following statement?
	```python
	if __name__ === "__main__"
	```
- [ ] What is the mangled name of the method `__getname()` defined in a class student?
- [ ] List down any  4 built-in exceptions of python.

### Part B
- [ ] Apply sorted function to
	- Sort `n = [10, 6, 5, 9, 2]` in descending order.
	- Sort `w = ['banana' ,'apple', 'cherry']` by string length.
	- Sort `t = [(1, 'banana'),(2, 'apple'),(3, 'cherry')]` by the second element.
- [ ] Solve the problem arouse in running the following program?
	```python
	class A:
		def __init__(self, i):
			self.i = i
	def main():
		a  = A()
		print(a, i)
	main()
	```
- [ ] Utilize transformation functions to display
	- "Even" for even numbers and "Odd" for odd numbers.
	- Maximum element in a list.
- [ ] Make use of transformation functions to display the following from the list L, in the range(1, 11).
	- Square of the values.
	- Values divisible by 3.

### Part C
- [ ] Construct a class named Account that contains:
	1. A protected attribute id for the account, A private attribute balance for the account.
	2. A constructor with id 000, balance 1000
	3. A public method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account.
	4. A public method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account.
	5. A private method to find the balance.
- [ ] Develop Python program to
	- Overload '-' operator to subtract two complex numbers
	- Overload '<' operator to compare two numbers.
